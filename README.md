According to the Ireland visa
[processing page](https://www.ireland.ie/en/india/newdelhi/services/visas/processing-times-and-decisions/),
the New Delhi Visa office publishes results of all Visa applications daily at 11
AM (IST).

This service scrapes off the ODS document from the page periodically[1] and
keeps a queriable copy of the Visa outcome data which can then be used to
generate insights and check status via a simple API.

[1] Runs every day twice, 12 PM and 12 AM IST.

Note: This is a personal project and is not affiliated with any government body.
The data is provided as is and should not be considered as the official source
of information. According to the website, Visa outcome data is hosted on behalf
of the Irish Immigration Service.
